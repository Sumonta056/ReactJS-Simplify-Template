          How do I customize the color scheme of components?
        </Accordion.Title>
        <Accordion.Content>
          <p>
            The Keep React offers a range of color variants for
            components. To customize the color scheme, you can use the available
            color options such as gray,info,error,warning and success. Simply
            set the desired color variant as a prop when using the component,
            and it will reflect the chosen color.

          Can I add additional content to notifications?
        </Accordion.Title>
        <Accordion.Content>
          <p>
            Yes, the Notification component in the Keep React allows you
            to include extra content alongside the primary message. The
            additionalContent prop can be used to display supplementary
            information, such as buttons, links, or icons, within the
            notification to provide users with more context and options.
